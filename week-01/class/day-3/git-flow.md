## Git Flow

First Step

Navigate and Locate the directory we want to track
cd's, ls's, pwd's

Our directory in terminal/git bash should the project we want to track

Ex. example_project whos parent is all_project_folder

all_projects_folder
----example_project

git init
  ONLY RAN ONCE

or if adding remote repository to local
git clone github_url

1. git status - check repo status, what has changed recently
2. git add (files or .) (. == all files/folders)
3. git commit -m "an informative message"


To add our local changes to remote repository

1. git push origin main
