What did you learn yesterday?

1. loops
   1. while loop - iterates while condition is true
   2. do while loop - iterate once, regardless of condition, will continue if condition is true
   3. for loop - better for iterate through numbers, set amounts
      1. for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {} - loops 100 times
      2. for (definition; condition; modifier)
   4. for each loop - best to iterate through an array
      1. for (arrayValue : array) {}
2. arrays
   1. array.length - amount of values
   2. index starts at 0
   3. Arrays.sort(array) - sorts in ascending
   4. dataType[] variableName = {value, value2};
   5. arrays are of fixed size
3. methods
4. dot notation
   1. accessing a property or method of an object
   2. ex. Object.value <- '.' is referring to dot notation
5. throw exception - ERROR
6. Thread.sleep(1000)  - accepting value in milliseconds, 1000ms = 1s

int[] grades = {100, 50, 80}

System.out.println(grades[4]) - Exception: index 4 is out of bounds
