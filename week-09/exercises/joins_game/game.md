# MySQL JOINs Game ðŸŽ¯

## Setup
- Each student gets their own table with sample data
- There are 5 "hub" tables that others will connect to

## Round 1: Find Your Connection (10 min)

Walk around and figure out:

- **If you have the hub table**: "Which of my records connect to someone else's table and who has that table?"
- **If you don't have the hub**: "Who are has the hub table that relates to my data"

Write down the related tables name and columns you will need to answer your question.

## Round 2: Write Your JOIN (15 min)

Everyone writes **one SQL JOIN query** connecting their table to exactly one other table.

**Submit your individual query** - I'll run them and show the results.

**Remember**: Everyone will only need to write one query.
