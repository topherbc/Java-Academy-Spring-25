Homework Machine
Shel Silverstein

The Homework Machine, oh the Homework Machine,
Most perfect contraption that's ever been seen.
Just putin your homework, then drop in a dime,
Snap on the switch, and in ten seconds' time,
Your homework comes out, quick and clean as can be.
Here it is--"nine plus four?" and the answer is "three."
Three?
Oh me...
I guess it's not as perfect
As I thought it would be.
